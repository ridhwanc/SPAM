# SPAM

## Abstract 

The word “spam” is defined as an irrelevant or inappropriate message sent on the internet to a large number of recipients. Throughout my time of using social media, one of the most annoying and frightening things of the internet is spam. To most, spam is very obvious to detect. However, there are many people that fall victim to links provided in spam messages, tweets and emails. The problem I break down in this project is exploring the percentage of spam tweets on Twitter, a social media app used by millions of people worldwide. 

## Objective 

This project aims to explore the percentage of tweets that are considered spam per day, on the social media application “Twitter”. 

## Motivation 

### What is the problem that motivates you to build this product?
The purpose of this program is to explore the percentage of spam tweets created in a day. Spam is a security issue that is not emphasized due to the large amount of legitimate data covering it up on a minute-by-minute basis. Spam can manipulate the user in many forms such as money scams and revenge porn cases to a random, unintentional messages to all of your followers. 
### Why is this problem important to be addressed?  
In exploring the legitimacy of data that is put out to the public, we can determine whether spam can be considered a “security breach” or should stay neglected as a simple “low-risk”, “low-priority” error that many applications encounter. 
### Who are the users of the product?
This project addresses users who regularly use Twitter as their main platform of social media. As they are the target audience that would be heavily affected by spam tweets.
### What is the expected outcome and the utility of the product?
The expected outcome of this program would be to provide factual evidence that spam tweets are a large percentage of tweets that are put out on a daily basis. On that hypothesis, the program’s function can be shown to the company Twitter, in which they can make this issue a larger priority. As a result, they could place a strong emphasis on reducing the number of spam tweets that exist on Twitter. This, in effect, will strengthen the security and safety of the platform as a whole for users.
